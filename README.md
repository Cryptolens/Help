# SKM Wiki Engine
This repository contains a wiki engine and wiki articles for SKM's help page.

## Viewing pages locally (server.py)
Th wiki engine needs to be able to access the file system, in order to render the pages properly. You can either use Apache or the small Python server script. If you have Python 3.*, simply run the `server.py` script.
