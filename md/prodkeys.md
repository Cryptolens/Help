# Key
A Key is a 20 letters long string, for example, `MUYVD-LSEBY-CXHRQ-XFAGY` which stores information about the current license. 
That is, the key tells the software what kind of features should be enabled, whether there is a time restriction (the number of 
days that the software can be used) or a quota for doing something. These are just some of the examples of what a key can do.

# Product
A Product is a way to organize your keys. Your software can be associated with one product, for example. 
All keys in a product share the same generation password, which can be used with SKGL API.
