# Key
A (license) key is a 20 letters long strong, eg. `MUYVD-LSEBY-CXHRQ-XFAGY`, that has
license information associated with it. For example, it can store info such as:

* Trial key or subscription (time-limited)
* Customer information
* Custom variables

These are just some of the examples of what a key can do.

# Product
A Product is a way to organize your keys. Normally, you will name the product the same
as your application. For serial key generation purposes, you will need to specify an algorithm:
either [SKGL](https://skgl.codeplex.com/) or SKM15. We recommend SKM15.
