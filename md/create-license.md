# Create a Key

We're now ready to test the code using your account.

1. Select the product from the <a href="https://serialkeymanager.com/Product" target="blank">list</a>.
2. Click on 'Create a new Key'.
3. Check features 3,4,5.
4. Optionally, if you want to have a time limit, check feature 1 too.

In case you kept the code as it is (without replacing the token and pubkey with yours),
you can test the following:

* `IWXAZ-FVMOD-KBZQU-DKUFW` - all features in one years since this tutorial was written
* `IYVOO-JCWXQ-LCRBI-ZAIQZ` - all features but the recorder with no time constraint.

## Done!
