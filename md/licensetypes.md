<td><p>This model enables you to securely distribute trial versions of your product, which the user can easily upgrade.</p>

<p>A trial license can either be time-limited (eg. 30 days) or not. When it's not time-limited, it can have a reduced set features 
(eg. lite version). Once the time limit is reached, it can either disable the entire application or just certain features.
</p>
<p>The user can later upgrade the same license key to be able to get a full-featured version of the application.</p>
