<td><p>This model enables you to securely distribute trial versions of your product, which your customer can easily upgrade.</p>
<p>A trial license can either be time-limited (eg. 30 days) or not. When it's not time-limited, it can have a reduced set features 
(eg. lite version). Once the time limit is reached, it can either disable the entire application or just certain features.
</p>
<p>The user can later upgrade the same license key to be able to get a full-featured version of the application.</p>

<tr>
<td>Subscription</td>
<td><p>A subscription is when you give access to your product for a limited period of time.
</p>
<p>
Instead of offering your application as a 'product', you can offer it it as a 'service'
(for example, your customers may get addition support together with the product during the subscription period).
</p> 
<p>
This model is good because it provides you with a recurring revenue stream.
